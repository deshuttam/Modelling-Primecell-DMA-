# Modelling Primecell DMA using SystemC

By Uttam Deshpande, Akshay Bhosale.

Hardware behaviour is the core of any electronic system and it is essential to know the hardware behaviour before mass producing the hardwares. Hence, to test the design we require a software model also known as virtual prototype, which can be used for testing before its production. Here we are using SystemC to model our peripheral. SystemC is basically a modelling library. It is a set of C++ classes and macros which enables a designer to simulate hardware behaviour. By creating models of the hardware, software development can be started early. This reduces the time to market of the product. The primary use of SystemC is high level systems modelling of hardware. One such hardware/peripheral example is the prime cell DMA controller provided by ARM limited. 
* The objective of the project is to model this peripheral using SystemC library and test its functionality using a test bench.

## Introduction
System Modelling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. Virtual Prototyping (VP), is a software-based engineering discipline that involves modelling a system, simulating and visualising its behaviour below real world operational conditions, and purification its vogue through an reiterative methodology. VP is increasingly used as a substitute for quick prototyping. VP does not manufacture a entity for testing and analysis but, as it carries out task on a mere laptop. Virtual prototyping results in faster time-to-market through earlier and faster computer code package development and improved communication throughout the availability chain. They allow software package engineers to begin out development months before the hardware vogue is complete, enabling full system bring-up to occur within days of semiconductor accessibility. Virtual prototypes square measure fast, whole sensible computer code package models of complete systems that execute unrestricted production code and provide distinctive efficiency.
